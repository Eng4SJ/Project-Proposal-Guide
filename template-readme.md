## Background

TODO: Brief (1paragraph) overview of the context surrounding the problem of focus.

## Objective 

TODO: How would a technological component be able help here?

## High Level Requirements

TODO: What specific functionality is necessary for the project to have substantive impact? What would constitute stretch goals? Minimum/Basics/Extras breakdown?

## Ethics/Social Justice Concerns

  + TODO: How might this project reinforce the unjustices at play if the engineers on it do not seek sufficiently broad perspective about their implementation?
  + TODO: What oft-overlooked pitfalls exist in the technical space the users are likely to enter that the engineers should put forth active effort to avoid?

## Provided Materials

  + TODO: Are there any materials provided which the engineering students may find useful?
  + TODO: Are there any recommended terms for further research by the engineers exploring this project?
