# Guide to the Engineering For Social Justice Project Proposal Collection

Welcome!
TODO: intro

# How to Use
## For Engineers & Engineering Students

1. Find a project proposal you find interesting and feasible! Projects are listed [here](https://github.com/Eng4SJ).
1. Students: acquire permission from your professor to tackle the project.
1. Research the surrounding topics further. These projects commonly occupy a nuanced position, and much harm or waste has been caused in the past by engineers deprioritizing the development of sufficient understanding of the topics at play before drawing any diagrams.
1. Fork the project proposal!
1. Implement the project to the best of your ability while adhering to the project course requirements!

## For Engineering Educators running Senior Design Project Courses

Simply provide the students with a link to this github organization along with a description, like this one:

> TODO: write this description

Alternatively, a more formal assignment-style writeup is available [here](assignment_writeup.md)

# How to Contribute a Project Proposal

1. Use the script provided [here](gitcreate.sh) in this repository to create a new project proposal folder of a given name in your $ENG4SJ_TLDir directory. It will also create the related github project on this organization page, and setup the git connections all easylike.
1. Fill out the remaining fields of the Project Proposal according to the documentation below. Additional documentation about how students will be using the project proposal are available [here](proposal_considerations.md).

## Sections of a Project Proposal
- **Background**

	Brief (1paragraph) overview of the context surrounding the problem of focus.
- **Objective**

    How would a technological component be able help here?
- **High Level Requirements**

	What specific functionality is necessary for the project to have substantive impact? What would constitute stretch goals?
- **Ethics/Social Justice Concerns**

  + How might this project reinforce the unjustices at play if the engineers on it do not seek sufficiently broad perspective about their implementation?
  + What oft-overlooked pitfalls exist in the technical space the users are likely to enter that the engineers should put forth active effort to avoid?
- **Provided Materials**

  + Are there any materials provided which the engineering students may find useful?
  + Are there any recommended terms for further research by the engineers exploring this project?

# Providing Feedback on a Project Proposal

Feel free to create issues (on the relevant repository or this repository) or reach out to [haniawni](https://github.com/haniawni). Note that many projects are deliberately intended to steer students toward reading further research in Engineering and Social Justice topics.
