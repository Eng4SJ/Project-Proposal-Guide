# Guide to the Engineering For Social Justice Project Proposal Collection

Welcome!
This project proposal repository is a source for engineering for social justice project proposal. Designed for use by undergraduate engineering students beginning the common capstone Senior Design Project course, it aims to provide the technologiccally-feasible seed idea highlighting a potential application along with the framing & guiding content necessary to learn human-centered design for community or social justice. It also provides a framework for recontextualizing Engineering for Social Justice work as integral to the role of the engineer, in better alignment with the commonly-cited engineering goal of making the world a better place.

# How to Use
## For Engineers & Engineering Students

1. **Read the [Student Usage Guide](StudentUsageGuide.md),** which clarifies the requirements and considerations relevant for all engineering for social justice projects.
1. **Find a project proposal** you find interesting and feasible! Projects are listed [here](https://github.com/Eng4SJ).
1. **Acquire permission** from your professor to tackle the project, negotiating any modifications to course requirements as explained in the Student Usage Guide.
1. **Research** the surrounding topics further. These projects commonly occupy a nuanced position, and much harm or waste has been caused in the past by engineers deprioritizing the development of sufficient understanding of the topics at play before drawing any diagrams.
1. **Fork** the project proposal!
1. **Implement the project** to the best of your ability while adhering to the project course requirements! Routine community feedback will be immensely useful in ensuring efficacy.
1. **Submit a 1st pull request** to this repository including your current course on the Collaborating Course List!
1. **Submit a 2nd pull request** to this repository describing any novel requirements your Senior Design Course included, and/or your approaches for adapting them to fit Eng4SJ projects!
1. **Continue to support the project** as time moves forward, as discussed in the Student Usage Guide and relevant to your design.

## For Engineering Educators running Senior Design Project Courses

Simply provide the students with a link to this [Engineering For Social Justice Github Repository](https://github.com/Eng4SJ/Project-Proposal-Guide) along with a description, like this one:

> Modern dimensions of oppression- racism, sexism, ableism, and more- are commonly dubbed 'social' problems outside the role or capacities of an engineer to address. Why? Why do we discard the entire skillset we've developed as soon as we face societal injustices? **_As engineers, we have uniquely powerful potential to live not in resignation to the painful injustices of our world, but to actively work in opposition to them._** Doing so, however, requires nuance, humility, collaboration, and an explicit focus on the actual goal of mitigating, preventing, or undermining oppressive social dynamics. If you're interested in addressing existing, real problems living people face, as opposed to pursuing market needs, personal whimsy, or a paid contract, guidance along with several seed projects is available at the [Eng4SJ Project Repository](https://github.com/Eng4SJ/Project-Proposal-Guide).

## For Educators teaching Engineering and Social Justice content to students or other educators

Depending on the goals and curriculum of your course, this repository will likely be most useful as simply a source of undeniably-implementable engineering projects whose deprioritization is nigh impossible to justify, even to an ardent opponent of the development of a more socially-conscious engineering practice. 

In addition, I've provided a **lesson plan teaching how to find these potential projects** and how to document them [here](). This lesson plan focuses on several key thrusts:
- *Finding Structural Causes:* Generalized Lotus Diagrams, multiple scales of analysis
- *Unblocking Engineers' Ideation:* challenging assumptions, breaking functional and field fixedness, finding better frameworks
- *Verifying Appropriateness:* seeking outside perspective, avoiding common failure modes
- *Documenting Project Proposals:* fitting engineering for social justice projects within the growing design-thinking-focused framework, clear communication of problem definition along with the proposed system's expectations and priorities.

I'd be ecstatic to collaborate on any such lesson or course, and would absolutely love contributions of project proposals that result. I'm hoping to run such a lesson myself when possible. 

Note that the project proposals currently populating this repository consititute a very small fraction of the potential projects that I have gathered. Please contact my gmail at hani.awni+ENG4SJ to get in touch about the ever-growing collection of 'not-yet-fleshed-out' seed ideas at this intersection. These can additionally serve well as backup in case participants in ideation workshops have difficulty concieving of productive social-justice-oriented applications of the engineering knowledge they have.

Lastly, ESJ educators may be interested in using the Mastodon social media instance at [m.socialjustice.engineering](https://m.socialjustice.engineering) to connect with other educators, researchers, and practicing engineers interested in engineering and social justice. For context, Mastodon is an open-source, federated social media analogous to a multitude of separate Twitters capable of cross-communication. I'm active on that instance as [@twryst](https://m.socialjustice.engineering/@twryst), and am the admin; feel free to submit a brief application as directed on the registration page itself.

# How to Contribute a Project Proposal

1. Use the shell script provided [here](gitcreate.sh) in this repository to create a new project proposal folder of a given name in your $ENG4SJ_TLDir directory. It will also create the related github project on this organization page, and setup the git connections all easylike.
1. Fill out the remaining fields of the Project Proposal according to the documentation below. Additional documentation about how students will be using the project proposal are available [here](proposal_considerations.md).


## Sections of a Project Proposal
- **Background**

	Brief (1paragraph) overview of the context surrounding the problem of focus.
- **Objective**

    How would a technological component be able help here?
- **High Level Requirements**

	What specific functionality is necessary for the project to be meaningfully complete? What about to have truly substantive impact? What would constitute stretch goals?
- **Ethics/Social Justice Concerns**

  + How might this project reinforce the unjustices at play if the engineers on it do not seek sufficiently broad perspective about their implementation?
  + What oft-overlooked pitfalls exist in the technical space the users are likely to enter that the engineers should put forth active effort to avoid?
  + What subleties exist around the social dimensions that an unfamiliar but well-intentioned engineer might overlook?

- **Provided Materials**

  + Are there any materials provided which the engineering students may find useful?
  + Are there any recommended terms for further research by the engineers exploring this project?


# Providing Feedback on a Project Proposal

Feel free to create issues (on the relevant repository or this repository) or reach out to [haniawni](https://github.com/haniawni). Note that many projects are deliberately intended to steer students toward reading further research in Engineering and Social Justice topics.
