# CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT


## Ideation Workshop/Lesson

### Objectives:
This add-on lesson plan follows a ‘diagnostic’ event exploring current social injustices in order to engage future engineers with finding ‘targeted interventions’, in the form of feasible project proposals, that can undermine or prevent such injustice or address related needs.

### Themes:
- Finding Structural Causes and Consequences: Generalized Lotus Diagrams, multiple scales of analysis
- Unblocking Engineers' Ideation: challenging assumptions, breaking functional and field fixedness, finding better frameworks
- Verifying Appropriateness: seeking outside perspective, avoiding common failure modes
- Documenting Project Proposals: fitting engineering for social justice projects within the growing design-thinking-focused framework, clear communication of problem definition along with the proposed system's expectations and priorities.

### Takeaways:
- To internalize that engineers of all disciplines are capable of working toward social justice, driven home with a fleshed-out personally-relevant example.
- Learn to notice underlying limiting assumptions at play impairing this effort, including:
  - Problems span multiple scales of analysis
  - Target causes rather than symptoms
  - Few problems have 3 or fewer causes, even if that’s where it stops being easy.
  - There’s no meaningful distinction between technical vs social problem or solution dynamics.
  - The purpose is the problem, not how it needs my narrowly-defined subfield.
  - My tools are useful in nonstandard ways.
  - I know more than my specialization.
